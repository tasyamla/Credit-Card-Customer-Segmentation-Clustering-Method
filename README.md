# Customer Segmentation using Clustering Method
---
This repository contains the code and documentation for performing customer segmentation on a bank's credit card dataset using various clustering techniques. The project is focused on identifying distinct customer segments that can be targeted with tailored marketing strategies.

# Overview
Customer segmentation is a crucial step in understanding the different groups of customers that a business serves. By grouping customers with similar characteristics, businesses can offer more personalized services, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profitability. In this project, we use a dataset from a bank to create a customer segmentation model using clustering algorithms.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a bank's credit card customer data. It contains various features related to customer spending behavior, demographics, and account information. The primary goal is to cluster customers into distinct groups based on these features.

# Clustering Models Used
In this project, we utilize three clustering techniques:
- Elbow Method
- Silhoutte Score & Silhoutte Plot
- K-Means

# Skill
- Analysis and Visualization (EDA)
- Classification
- Machine Learning
